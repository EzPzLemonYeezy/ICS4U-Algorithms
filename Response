What did I learn:
In the investigation of algorithms I learned how to solve a pyramix duo. It taught me how to look for key points and patterns in order to move the pieces to where I want them. Learning to solve this, and many more to come, teaches me about understanding algorithms and how it can take multiple steps just to move a colour to the desired location. In order to solve the pyramix, I had to quickly spot where all the colors needed to line up, and set it up, so that the last move will complete it.

What did I like:
I definitely liked actually solving it, eventhough its a simple version, its a start. I liked seeing the patterns and the steps you need to take. Then, actually moving the pieces and observing everything fall into place.
